# DBS311_Assignment2

## This is a repository for DBS311's Assignment 2 for the Summer Semester, 2020.

There are two things to do for a full set-up.

### FIRST  
* Locate to DBS311_Assignment2/assignment2/assignment2/ass2.sql.
* Run the file ass2.sql in your Oracle SQL Developer.  
  
**This file contains all the PL/SQL stored procedures needed for the assignment.**  
*--> Refer to the assignment requirements for more details on these procedures.*

### SECOND  
* The main cpp file is located in *DBS311_Assignment2/assignment2/assignment2/DBS311_ASS2_NHAN.cpp.*  
* It is fully functional although minor errors have not been handled yet.  
* **Most of the error handling is with DBS connection and running DBS statements.**  
* These error handling requirements are commented in the file.
* Also, the procedures does not have exception handling either. Exception handling in these procedures might be needed for error handling in cpp file.
